        <h1>Iwama Ryu</h1>
        <p>Iwama Aikido is practiced at the Kapiti Aikido Dojo.
          Iwama Ryu refers the style of Aikido that was taught by Saito Morihiro Sensei.
          Saito Sensei was one of Master Ueshibasâ€™ top students, living alongside and training with the master for 23 years. Upon Master Ueshibas death, Saito Sensei became the caretaker of the Aiki Shrine and the Dojo-cho of Ibaragi Aiki Dojo in Iwama, Japan
        </p>
        <p>
          Saito Sensei (9th Dan) traveled around the world teaching Aikido, as taught to him by Master Ueshiba, striving to preserve the techniques of the founder. He passed away on 13 May 2002.
        </p>
        <p>
          His son, Saito Hitohiro Sensei, like his father, is dedicated to teaching the Aikido of the founder during his years in Iwama.
        </p>

        <h1>The Founder of Aikido</h1>
        <p>
          Master Ueshiba, the founder of modern Aikido, was born in Tanabe, Japan, on 14 December 1883. His life was devoted to the traditional Budo arts of Japan. He became a very strong, skilled and revered martial artist. After becoming concerned with the meaning and objectives of the arts he had mastered, Master Ueshiba established that true self-defense was not winning over others, but winning over the discord within oneself. Through his efforts Aikido was developed as away to divert harm from oneself, whilst not needing to inflict serious injury on an aggressor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Master Ueshiba left behind him an art and philosophy rich in spirit and kindness. He passed on in Iwama, Japan, on April 26 1969 at the age of 86.
        </p>

        <h1>Aikido Training</h1>

        <h2>Taijutsu</h2>
        <p>
          Taijutsu is body training where you learn to defend against unarmed attacks from one or more attackers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aikido techniques range from restraining and pinning techniques to throwing techniques.
        </p>

        <h2>Bukiwaza</h2>
        <p>
          Bukiwaza is the practice of weapon techniques. Aikido weapons training consists of Aiki-Ken and Aiki-Jo techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
          Weapons training is an integral part of Aikido as it teaches the correct body posture for taijutsu techniques, and develops overall body strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the practice of Aiki-Ken, Aikidoka use a bokken (wooden sword),which is approximately 100cm in length and similar in shape to a katana.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aiki-Ken has seven basic movements called suburi, and many blending practices called awase, which lead into the practice of Kumi-Tachi (paired practice).
        </p>
        <p>
          A Jo (wooden staff) approximately 2.5cm in diameter and 130cm in length is used in the practice of Aiki-Jo.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aiki-Jo has twenty basic movements (suburi). Aiki-Jo also has two katas, which are practiced alone first, and then with a partner. This practice leads into the practice of Kumi-Jo (paired practices).
